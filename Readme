 This project is a demo for Selenium with hybrid framework , where testng and maven are used
 I am generating dynamic xml file, where the data for test cases to be executed is pulled from datasheet, and a dynamic xml 'runtimeTestng.xml' is created.
 'Triggeringprogram' is the java class that has code to create the dynamic xml.
 Run the testng.xml file, which triggers the 'Trigerringprogram.java', which inturn creates the dynamic xml 'runtimeTestng.xml'
